# 🧠 Advanced Concepts Implemented

### DTO Pattern

Request & Response DTOs are used to separate internal entities from API communication.

Examples:

- `EmployeeRequestDTO`
- `DepartmentRequestDTO`
- `EmployeeProfileRequestDTO`
- `ProjectRequestDTO`
- `LeaveRequestDTO`

---

### Bean Validation (`@Valid`)

Validation rules implemented using:

- `@NotBlank`
- `@NotNull`
- `@Email`
- `@Pattern`
- `@Size`
- `@Positive`
- `@PastOrPresent`
- `@FutureOrPresent`

Example validations:

✔ PAN format validation  
✔ Aadhaar validation  
✔ SSN validation  
✔ Password strength validation  
✔ Email validation

---

### Dynamic Search & Filtering

Employee search implemented using:

- **Specification API / QueryDSL**

Supports filtering by:

- Employee Name
- Department
- Skills

Endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/employees/search
```

---

### Pagination

Implemented using:

- `Pageable`
- `Page<EmployeeDTO>`

Supports:

- Page Number
- Page Size
- Sorting

Endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/employees
```

---

### Transaction Management

Implemented using:

```java
@Transactional
```

Used in:

- Department salary raise
- Employee transfer
- Critical update operations

---

### Global Exception Handling

Centralized exception handling implemented using:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
```

Handles:

- Resource not found
- Validation errors
- Business exceptions
